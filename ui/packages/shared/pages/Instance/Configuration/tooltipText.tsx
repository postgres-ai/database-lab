      Docker image used to run all database containers â€“ clones, snapshot

      behavior: e.g., Postgres is not the first process used to start container,
      so Postgres restarts are possible, they do not trigger container state
      change. For details, see{' '}

      value used here is '1GB', then the theoretical limit of the number of
      clones is 32. Practically, this limit is even lower because some memory is
      consumed by various other processes. If you need more clones, reduce the

      DBLab. With this approach, we have faster restore time, but we need to keep
      in mind that we can also have higher usage of CPU and disk IO on this
      machine (up to temporary saturation of resources). For subsequent
      refreshes, if DBLab is constantly used, it is recommended to reduce this
      value by 50% to keep some room for normal use of DBLab (such as work with
      clones).
